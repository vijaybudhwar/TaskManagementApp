# TaskManagementApp
Task Management Application Development

Step 1: Set up the project

Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if you haven't already.
Create a new Next.js project by running the following command in your terminal:

" npx create-next-app task-management-app "
Change into the project directory:

" cd task-management-app "

Step 2: Install dependencies

Install TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and MST (mobx-state-tree) by running the following command:
'''
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
npm install mobx mobx-react-lite mobx-state-tree
'''
Step 3: Configure Tailwind CSS

Create a Tailwind CSS configuration file by running the following command:

" npx tailwindcss init -p "

This will create a tailwind.config.js file and postcss.config.js file in your project root.
